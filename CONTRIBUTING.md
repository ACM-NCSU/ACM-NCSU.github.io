# Contributing to ACM/AITP @ NCSU's website

Thanks for your interest! To contribute, follow these steps:

0. Get [set up](#setup)

1. Find a task on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DEwSWYSD/acm-aitp-main-software-project-board-https-githubcom-acm-ncsu-acm-aitp-coursepro-projects-1). Each Trello task is usually
paired with a GitHub issue; the GitHub issues are specific to the website, and have more detailed information on what work needs to be done. Here's an example GitHub issue: https://github.com/ACM-NCSU/ACM-NCSU.github.io/issues/15

2. [Branch off master](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and complete the task! Usually this'll entail writing a post describing a Tech Talk or other activity the club's involved in. Posts are usually written in Markdown, which is pretty well explained here: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet (but feel free to use raw HTML if you like).

Look in the `_posts` directory in the repo for example posts. 

3. Once complete, open a PR (pull request) to the master branch of the repo. This tells us you've completed the task, and are ready to have your work (from your branch you made in step 2) integrated into the actual website. 

Don't fully understand how pull requests work? Reach out on the ACM/AITP Slack channel, and see here for guidance: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

4. Once the PR is opened, an ACM/AITP officer will review your work, and (maybe) ask for some changes. Once everything is in order, your code will be merged - congrats, you've contributed!

## Setup

Our website uses a tool called Jekyll, which allows us to use the following workflow:

1. Write a post for the website in Markdown
2. Preview it locally to make sure our changes are exactly what we want
2. Get the post into the master branch of the GitHub repo via a PR (pull request)
3. Voila, it appears on the website! 

Sometimes, we want to preview what our changes to the website would look like, which we can do on our local branch on our local machine. This requires we have Jekyll and co. already setup on our local machine, which we can do by following these instructions: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/. Ask away on the ACM/AITP Slack if you have an issue trying to get set up. 

Let us know if these instructions aren't helpful, and can be improved!
