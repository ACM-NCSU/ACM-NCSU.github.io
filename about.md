The ACM/AITP club at NC State is committed to bringing together Computer Science students and professionals to inspire dialogue and introduce students to the working world.

# Events
We pursue these aims by holding a number of events each semester such as:
+ <b>Tech Talks</b> where professionals come to give a short presentation on their company or a technology that they are passionate about.
+ <b>Workshops</b> which are similar to Tech Talks, but more interactive.
+ <b>Social Events</b> that strengthen the local computer science community.
+ <b>Pig Pickin'</b> which is our annual barbeque event where we invite the whole community and all of our sponsors over for good food!
