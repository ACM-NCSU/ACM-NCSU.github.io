The best way to reach out to the ACM/AITP officers is via
[email](mailto:{{site.email}}).

If you're an NC State student, you should check out our [Get Involved](http://getinvolved.ncsu.edu/organization/acm-aitp-ncsu) page;
it has plenty of resources to help you reach out to, or even join the
organization!

### Meeting locations
We usually host our Workshops and Tech Talks in room 1231 in
Engineering Building 2, on NC State's Centennial Campus. 1231 is in the east wing
(CSC side) of the building. Event times often depend on the availability of a
company representative, so our [Calendar]({{site.url}}/calendar) is the
best place to go for up to date info!

### Interested in giving a Tech Talk or hosting a Workshop?
We love having companies come over to give a
Tech Talk to our general body, or even host a workshop on a specific
technology.

Some of our previous workshop topics have included industry standard tools, like
SQL. Tech Talks are more oriented to a specific company practice or technology
that someone's really passionate about - for example, we had representatives from
[Vanguard come to talk about the MEAN stack and Hadoop]({% post_url 2017-3-21-vanguard %})!

Reach out to us, either via email, or through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc61TRS90Utj2S7wH9dmsUiiwsmhDxI7IGrJYvN1nOa0ODGeQ/viewform) - we'd love to
develop relationships with new companies while strengthening our connections
with previous participants.
