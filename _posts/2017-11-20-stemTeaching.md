This summer, iD Tech will hire over 1,600 instructors and staff from across the world to show students, ages 6 to 18, firsthand how their interests in technology can turn into fun learning experiences. We also have programs that emphasize tech education for girls, teens, tweens and younger children.

We’re looking for energetic, tech-savvy, summer staff who understand the need for quality technology education for young students. So why not spend your summer instructing, mentoring, and building your resume in one of our amazing programs? You’ll make a positive impact on the lives of students this summer and potentially inspire them to aim for big ambitions. Our summer jobs are as fulfilling as they are fun!

Staff members receive competitive compensation, room & board (overnight staff only), custom built apps supporting operations and curriculum, college internship credit (if applicable), guidance from our experienced team of managers, and more.

Take the first step to a great summer! [Learn more & Apply today!](https://idtech-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1j4Uy2obbhOss9L-PHGIcR35SA9XQ51E366AeJi959mc-675099623&key=YAMMID-71724833&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.idtech.com%2Fjobs)
