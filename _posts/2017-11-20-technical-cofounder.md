One of your fellow colleagues at NC State has started a company called BN/AFit,
a fitness app launching in January. The mission of BN/AFit is to promote physical
as well as mental health through a positive, encouraging community.  

Karly Pavlinac is leading the effort, and has already hired app developers to build
their product.  However, she is looking to hire more upon launch in January.
