Here are some upcoming opportunities for ACM/AITP members:

## Mozilla's Challenge
The Mozilla Foundation is being funded by NSF to host an open challenge concerning the accessibility, design, and resiliency of the Internet. It asks:

1. How can we leverage wireless technology to keep people connected in the aftermath of a disaster?
2. How can we leverage existing infrastructure to provide high-quality wireless connectivity to communities in need?

The challenge will involve two tracks, with two stages each, and will conclude in summer of 2018. First place awards $460,000 in total.

To attract applicants, Mozilla will host a series of networking events. The first will take place in Talley Student Union on Saturday, March 25 from 10:00-5:00 p.m.

Only 100 participants will be invited to attend, so [sign up](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd97uj6X64Yp0YyBsqgoJ9I72RStMeH6x_w36aS40PJYEcifQ/viewform) soon and spread the word!

## Summer Camp IT Specialist
The Southeastern Regional Manager for Summer Camp Operations for Youth Digital is currently hiring Summer Camp IT Specialists for their tech-based camps for kids ages 8-14 in the RDU area. They are partnering with local organizations (http://www.youthdigitalcamps.com/raleighdurham.html) to deliver amazing experiences!

From Mark Shivers, Southeastern Regional Manager for Summer Camp Operations

> We spend this summer making Kid's dreams come true. We offer exciting and cutting edge camps to kids ages 8-16 using innovative curriculum with cutting-edge immersion and project based classes. Students will learn from us not only how to code, illustrate, and render, but ultimately how to Create.

This is a paid position. Most camp days run from about 8:30am to 4:30pm (M-F) though some sites do vary. There is online training that can be completed on staff member's own time as well as one day of onsite training. Both of these are compensated. Staff will complete background screening and need reliable transportation to our partner schools.

Use [this form](http://www.youthdigitalcamps.com/jobs.html) to apply, or [email Mark Shivers](mailto:mark.shivers@youthdigital.com) for more information!
