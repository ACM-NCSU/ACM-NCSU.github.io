ACM/AITP will be hosting a SQL workshop led by Mark S. McDavid from Eastman Chemical,
going over the basics and usage of SQL to absolute beginners! Topics include: design
considerations for databases; the definitions for tables, stored procedures, queries,
indices, etc; simple and complex queries including simple SELECT statements, INNER JOIN,
OUTER JOIN, SELF JOINS; GROUP BY and HAVING statements. No experience is necessary, and
there'll be **free pizza and drinks**, so come on out! -->

On Thursday, we had Mark S. McDavid and a data science associate at Eastman come and give a talk on SQL, specifically Microsoft SQL Server. Eastman, like most companies, is quite reliant on data extraction and analysis for day to day operations, so SQL knowledge is pretty paramount!

Mark began with basic queries and database design, explaining how queries can be optimized for speed on large datasets. More complex statements were also discussed, such as joins, and the expressiveness of the SQL language was explored in depth.

The talk concluded with questions from the audience about security and best practices for dealing with databases - never run an untested SQL statement on a production server!
