Thursday, April 13th we have a great talk about Docker and other container technologies. Vincent Batts from Red Hat will come in and give a talk on container technology, current standards, and how all this is moving application development forward.

As always, Pizza and drinks will be provided and we will be in our usual room, 1231 in EB2.

A special thank-you to [LUG](https://lug.ncsu.edu) for helping to organize this event.
