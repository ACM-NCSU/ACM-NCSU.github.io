Correcting bugs can be painful. Some of the worst bugs are ones that only cause 
problems occasionally - resource leaks, network errors, and edge cases of all 
types. Logs can help to address these failures, but are difficult to comb 
through, and if you want any kind of aggregate statistic, you have to perform 
command-line acrobatics.

Datadog is a modern monitoring tool that helps track your applicationâ€™s 
performance in real time, identify bottlenecks, and detect recurring problems 
at a glance.

Software Developers Troy Rosenberg and Danny Rivers from ROI Revolution came 
to demonstrate to our students how they use Datadog to 
collect real-time metrics to respond to problems immediately and correct 
some of the most troublesome bugs.
