ACM/AITP will be hosting a SQL workshop led by Mark S. McDavid from Eastman Chemical,
going over the basics and usage of SQL to absolute beginners! Topics include: design
considerations for databases; the definitions for tables, stored procedures, queries,
indices, etc; simple and complex queries including simple SELECT statements, INNER JOIN,
OUTER JOIN, SELF JOINS; GROUP BY and HAVING statements. No experience is necessary, and
there'll be **free pizza and drinks**, so come on out!
