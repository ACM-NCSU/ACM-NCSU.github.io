This is the official website for NC State's ACM/AITP chapters! We've never had
our own website before, so we're currently putting it all together!

So far we have included our public [event calendar]({{ site.url }}/calendar/)
and eventually will include our [by-laws]({{ site.url }}/bylaw).

We're also hoping to add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to the end of
our posts so that members can post follow up questions to our Tech Talks,
but that has yet to be implemented.

Additionally we may use something like
[this](http://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/) to embed some
documents on the site.

Spread the word, and come join us at our next event!
