As we do tech talks, short synopses will appear in posts like this one.

So far we have included our public [event calendar]({{ site.url }}/calendar/) and eventually will include our [by-laws]({{ site.url }}/bylaw).

# Coming Soon to a theater near you
We're hoping to add [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to the end of our posts so that members can post follow up questions to our talks, but that has yet to be implemented.

Additionally we may use something like [this](http://jamesonzimmer.com/simple-pdf-embed-for-jekyll/) to embed some documents on the site.
