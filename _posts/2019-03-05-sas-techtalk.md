Thereâ€™s lots of work in the field of machine learning on researching algorithms 
to create powerful predictive models. In some industries, however, adoption of 
these algorithms has been slow due to a variety of reasons including, model 
trust, lack of understanding, and governmental regulations. To help address the 
adoption issue, researchers have worked in the field of explaining model 
predictions.

On Tuesday, March 5, Senior Machine Learning Developer, Ralph Abbey, PhD from 
SAS came to talk about the steps of a research and development project on 
model-agnostic methods for explanations of predictive models.
